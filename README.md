# Open Mainframe Project Foundation documents

This repository contains many of the governance and overview documents for the Open Mainframe Project, as much as possible in a format to easily track changes and updates. For any top-level projects referencing the Charter, Code of Conduct, or Branding Guidelines, it is preferred to reference this location to avoid any confusion and ensure you are using the most update to date resource.

In addition, you can [open issues](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/foundation/issues) for OMP staff and [track the various activites](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/foundation/projects) our operations teams are supporting.
