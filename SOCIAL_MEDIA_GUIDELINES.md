# OMP Social Media Guidelines
## Objectives
The objectives of OMP social media:
- Advance topics and conversations that are relevant to and beneficial for the Open Mainframe community
- Continue building positive affinity for OMP projects among key influencers and throughout Open Mainframe community
- Drive engagement and participation in OMP projects
## Themes and Topics
Informational, engaging, and ecosystem-focused content:
- OMP projects
- OMP end user community
- Contributor / SIG blog posts
- Open Mainframe ecosystem
- OMP event information and deadlines (i.e. CFP)
- Technical topics such as open source projects for the mainframe ecosystem and open source projects broadly that support the mainframe.
- Informational: Tutorials, editorials, news stories. Items that help connect the dots for our community
- Thought leadership: insights, perspectives, learnings, and experiences
## Strategy
- Keep messages positive and uplifting, consistent with the values and principles of the [Open Mainframe Project](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/foundation/blob/master/CHARTER.md)
- Communicate big picture ideas vs “announcements” or news. News will be positioned less like an announcement and more around what it means.
- Share content across social media channels that benefit the ecosystem as a whole
- Maintain a balance of posting on OMP activities/news and ecosystem-focused content
- Share vendor-neutral, community-sourced posts that are informational, engaging, and ecosystem-focused
- Engage with the community through retweets and sharing of community content.
- Follow influencers 
- Always tag (@mention) the company and the individual (if available) to increase reach
## General Guidelines
For all OMP social activity, we remain a neutral foundation. Examples of the type of content:
- Owned content is OMP news, blogs, case studies, survey data, etc.
- Project content is anything sourced from [OMP’s currently hosted projects](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/projects), including project news, roadmap updates, new releases, performance/security updates, blogs, conferences slides/videos, etc.
- Ecosystem content is vendor-neutral and project-impartial sourced from contributors, maintainers, ambassadors, news outlets, etc., including blog posts, news coverage, thought leadership bylines, technology demos, sketch notes, GitHub work, cloud native-specific Meetups, etc. 
  - OMP is not able to share anything on our channels that promotes a vendor product or directs to a company website.
  - Social posts from member company handles and/or vendor channels cannot be shared.
  - RTs are limited to news outlet handles, @linuxfoundation, @OpenMFProject project handles + personal handles.
  - Community content that abides by the channel guidelines + includes insight from/work with more than one OMP project will be prioritized for sharing.
  - Activities that are hosted by and open to the public can be promoted, as they benefit the ecosystem as a whole.
## Images & Videos
Images shared, unless specifically credited back to a community member, will meet the requirements of “free for commercial use” and “no attribution required.”
Hashtags
OMP uses hashtags in our posts:
- To measure the success of campaigns (for example, #OpenSourceSummit);
- To expand our reach beyond our current followers and tap into larger, trending topics on Twitter (for example, #openmainframe
- To organize or categorize shares (for example, #zowe).
## To request content to be shared
